# The Hobbit - Dwarves

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9.
This app demonstrates a list of the dwarves from the hobbit, and also allows you to add, delete and save dwarves to this list. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## HELP
Tony I PROMISE I tried everything in my power to launch this app on heroku but I kept getting a 503 error (App crashed) I have been googling how to fix and nothing is working so far.. I will link the app below.

Heroku App: https://angularjs-lotr.herokuapp.com/
GH Repo: https://github.com/MakaylaMR/Angular.js-LOTR

I hope this submission is still worth something I spent a long time on it.
